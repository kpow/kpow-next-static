Managed the Mobelux team who designed and developed Neighborhood Goods' entire technology stack that included a GraphQL Shopify API/CMS driven site, native consumer and associate applications, and Bluetooth micro-location for in-store delivery/assistance. Products created included digital signage, native application with location features, responsive e-commerce site, and a native associate application. Working with their team on strategy, we then executed all UX/design/development in-house. Using CI/CD, we were able to deploy at any time.
