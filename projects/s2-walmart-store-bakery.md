Our client's continued need for intricate layouts led me to design a hybrid production approach which capitalized on the platform's specific use cases and technical attributes. My S2 team used a layering technique with video and HTML to create dynamic menu boards with broadcast quality motion.

With an intricate layout that includes video, this menu board system broadcasts fidelity and dynamic content at every Walmart location and really shine in-store.
