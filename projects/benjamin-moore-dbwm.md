While at The Martin Agency, I was responsible for a portion of this fun project that implemented a campaign site where users took a quiz that resulted in generating a room of their dreams. 

I coded the quiz portion of the application while managing other implementation details. We had a great integration with a team in Berlin that provided all the room renders while our team implemented a WebGL overlay for applying the colors while still maintaining all the dynamic shading from the renders.
