excerpt: 'Established the technology and UX initiatives that resulted in the first touchscreen endcaps in Walmart for Starbucks.'

Walmart rolled out thousand of endcaps in their stores and S2 had the job to create a successful activation. I established the technology and UX initiatives but the technology constraints around both hardware capability and bandwidth made this a trickier one to figure out. Diligent teamwork with the client partnered with our thinking around the technology corner really knocked this project out of the park.
