excerpt: 'Designed the architecture and led the build of a static site generator coupled with a headless CMS for delivery of digital signage content.'

For a signage network as enormous as Walmart's, security is paramount. This factor along with the need to rapidly prototype and pilot new screens had me design and lead the build of a static site generator. Using compiled data sources and easing the deployment, we created a massively nimble system.

This project has been ongoing for over 8 years.
