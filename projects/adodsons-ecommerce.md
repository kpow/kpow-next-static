I have worked with Alison since my years in NYC. When she took over her mother's antique store after moving back to VA, she decides to kick it up a notch. As her retail storefront business started with e-commerce, I was able to help them develop a site that works for the Adosons concept, generate content maintenance strategies, and stay in front of all the little details that drag a vision down. We had done a ton of work pre-pandemic that paid off with the new site's launch and changing to use Shopify POS to create massive efficiency gains. These gains came at a crucial time as e-commerce ramped up during the pandemic.

I like this store because it carries the store's concept and the curation that the Adosons teams provide for the customer. This site isn't Amazon, and that's good. If you need a quick gift for just about anyone, she has you covered. boom!
